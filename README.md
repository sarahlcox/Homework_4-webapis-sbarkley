The guidelines of this assignment was to create a code quiz. When the quiz begins, a timer starts. If a question is answered inccorrectly, then it deducts time from the clock. When the game is over the player is prompted to save their name and score to local storage. 

The timer that I created was continuously not decrementing the seconds in the way I wanted it to, so I will be working on that a little more. I had to start this assignment over twice to make it act in the way that I wanted it to. I used
